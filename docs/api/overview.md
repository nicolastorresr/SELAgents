# SELAgents Framework Overview

## Introduction

SELAgents (Social-Emotional Learning Agents) is a Python framework for implementing artificial agents with social and emotional learning capabilities. The framework combines reinforcement learning with emotional processing models and theory of mind capabilities to create more sophisticated and human-like agent behaviors.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Emotional Processing

The framework implements emotional processing through:
- Emotional capacity parameters
- Dynamic emotional states
- Emotion-influenced decision making
- Emotional memory and learning

### 2. Social Dynamics

Social interactions are managed through:
- Network formation and evolution
- Coalition dynamics
- Social strategy selection
- Relationship strength tracking

### 3. Theory of Mind

Agents can model other agents' mental states via:
- Intention prediction
- Belief modeling
- Social context understanding
- Behavioral prediction

## Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
Agent
├── EmotionEngine
├── TheoryOfMind
├── EmotionalMemory
└── SocialStrategies
```

### Data Flow

1. Environmental Input → Agent
2. Agent → EmotionEngine → Emotional State
3. Agent → TheoryOfMind → Social Understanding
4. Agent → SocialStrategies → Action Selection
5. Action → Environment/Other Agents

## Integration Guidelines

### 1. Component Integration

When adding new components:
- Implement required interfaces
- Register with agent management system
- Add appropriate metrics
- Update visualization tools

### 2. Custom Extensions

To extend functionality:
- Subclass appropriate base classes
- Implement required methods
- Add new metrics as needed
- Update documentation

### 3. Environment Integration

For custom environments:
- Implement environment interface
- Define state space
- Specify action space
- Add appropriate rewards

## Best Practices

### 1. Performance Optimization

- Use vectorized operations
- Implement batch processing
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Profile performance bottlenecks

### 2. Memory Management

- Clear unused emotional memories
- Prune social networks
- Implement data cleanup
- Monitor memory usage

### 3. Error Handling

- Validate emotional states
- Check network consistency
- Handle coalition conflicts
- Log important events

## API Stability

### Stable APIs
- Core agent interfaces
- Basic emotional processing
- Network management
- Metrics calculation

### Beta Features
- Advanced coalition dynamics
- Enhanced theory of mind
- Dynamic resource management
- Advanced visualization tools
